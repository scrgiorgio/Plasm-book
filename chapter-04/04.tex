\chapter{Geometric models}
\label{chapt:4}

Julia |Plasm| is the best choice to develop geometric models for Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Computer-Aided Design (CAD). We ported the  functional language to Julia for better supporting design, model generation, and visualization of geometric objects. Geometric models specify the physical appearance of Architecture, Engineering, and Construction products at any scale, from structural and envelope components to whole buildings and built environments, and are used for design, tender, contract, and collaboration. 
In this chapter we introduce the great expressive power of |Plasm| parametric functions and the simple methods of parametric assemblies, where objects itself can be used as actual parameters. We show also that |Plasm| offers a very general mechanism (Julia dictionaries) to characterize and export models with colors, textures, materials, and so on. |Plasm| can be even embedded in the Jupiter platform to document the design choices step-by-step.
