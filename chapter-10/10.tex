\chapter{Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)}
\label{chapt:10}

The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) are an open international standard for sharing Building Information Model (BIM) data.
IFC is a non-proprietary file format used to exchange building information models. IFC files can share data between different software applications, making it possible for multiple stakeholders to collaborate on BIM projects. Of course, we are mostly interested in the IFC transport of shape information.
In this chapter, we, therefore, investigate the Julia |Plasm| ability to implement in a few rows of parametric code the classes and attributes of the |IfcShapeRepresentation|
entity for the various types of shape representation, including PointCloud, Curve, Surface, GeometricSet, GeometricCurveSet, Annotation2D, SurfaceModel, Tessellation, SolidModel, SweptSolid, AdvancedSweptSolid, Brep, CSG, Clipping, and BoundingBox.
