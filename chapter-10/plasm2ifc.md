# Plasm export to IFC

## From Plasm Objects to IFC Building Objects

### Introduction to Plasm datasets

The development version of the PLaSM functional and geometric language derived by Backus's visionary FL (programming at Function Level), 
is a Julia package named Plasm.jl

The functions in Plasm.jl may be evaluated to produce objects of type HPC (Hierarchical Polyhedra Complex), LAR (Linear Algebraic Representation), GEO (Geometric datasets, including 3D Point Clouds). 

+  HPC's object values are similar to graphs of XML objects, made by arrays of son objects of a node with attributes and by a dictionary of properties at node level. Intrinsically hierarchical data structure;
+  LAR's object values are a flat information structure which contains the spatial location of vertices of a set of polyhedral shapes, and some sparse matrices of topology to store linear operators between vector spaces of chains (subsets) of $d$-cells ($0\leq d\leq 3$) to compute incidence and adjacency;
+  GEO's object values ore containers of datasets with different parametric (intrinsic) and geometric (embedding) dimensions. The bulk of GEO objects implemented in Julia's package Plasm are multidimensional arrays, for example: $m$-vectors, for curve and polyline generation; ($m\times n$)-matrices for image storage and surface generation; ($m\times n\times p$)-triads (i.e., tensors of rank 3, for spatially organized 3D Point Cloud).

### Evaluation of Plasm functions

The evaluation of a Plasm function aiming to produce an IFC file is done within a functional environment where other Plasm functions were previously evaluated, so producing *named* HPC objects.

A named HPC object is an HPC value generated by Plasm and assigned to some Julia's name (identifier), using either language variables o instanced language functions which use other HPC named values. Every HPC value is intrinsically hierarchical, and representable as a tree.

The *names* of every HPC object, even parametric (i.e., functions instanced with actual parameters), used for its generation are registered inside the HPC object itself, and are used for exporting the named object to IFC files.

In order to export a Plasm value together with its work session to an IFC file, one **IFCCONFIG(root::HPC)::File** expression must be evaluated in the working session of the functional environment. The body of the **root** value (project) will contain a dictionary of IFC information associated to the root HPC value.
The keys of the dictionary, of type String, are either names of Plasm objects holding the value of a Plasm expression, or IfcPropertySet.

IfcPropertySet. See definition from buildingSMART: The IfcPropertySet defines all dynamically extensible properties. The property set is a container class that holds properties within a property tree. These properties are interpreted according to their name attribute.

Of course, when a Plasm session intends to export an IFC file, the names of Plasm objects, variables and parametric functions must be chosen carefully, to provide significant semantics to each generated value. 



### Building System in IFC

[IfcBuildingSystem](https://standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/RELEASE/IFC4/FINAL/HTML/schema/ifcsharedbldgelements/lexical/ifcbuildingsystem.htm)


The **Building System** is also a building organism (UNI 10838) understood as the structured set of spatial elements (*Environmental System*) and technical elements (*Technological System*), internal and external, pertinent to the building, characterized by their functions and their mutual relationships.
[Lâ€™edificio come sistema: il sottosistema ambientale](https://www.unirc.it/documentazione/materiale_didattico/1464_2015_396_22235.pd)


The **IfcBuilding** is used to build the spatial structure of a building (that serves as the primary project breakdown and is required to be hierarchical). The spatial structure elements are linked together by using the objectified relationship [**IfcRelAggregates**](https://standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/DEV/IFC4_2/FINAL/HTML/schema/ifckernel/lexical/ifcrelaggregates.htm).

### Building objects in IFC

When the IFC exporting is activated by evaluation of the Plasm2Ifc(root) one action of this process it to asses the *space* and/or *building* classification of each named Plasm value contained within the body of the root HPC object.

The assessment of IFC Entity of a named object is based on its geometric information. The triangles on its boundary are used to compute its Euler tensor, i.e., a matrix containing the Float64 values of inertia moments, inertia products and volume. The eigenvector analysis of this matrix provides important information about the space structure of the object shape. In particular, allows a classification as IfcBeam, IfcColumn, IfcWall, and IfcSlab. Furthermore, a space classification based on mass and coordinates distribution will allow other types of attribution of IFC types and entities.
