\chapter{Building Information Modeling (BIM)}
\label{chapt:9}

The construction industry is nowadays undergoing its very own digital revolution, helped by its unique way of working with BIM systems whose elements are the digital prototypes of physical elements like columns, windows, walls, doors, and stairs. 
In this chapter, we outline the conceptual foundations and the down of the BIM attitude of the construction industry, discuss the birth of concepts like building objects and the standardized taxonomy of building systems as set of subsystems devoted to the fulfillment of physical requirements of space with suitable performance levels. 
In particular, we show  by example how Julia |Plasm|, relying on its understand of topology, may automatically transform the preliminary shape design of spaces into the generic geometry of building subsystems (skeleton, envelope, internal partitions, vertical communications) and elements.
