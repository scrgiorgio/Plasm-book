   abstract   = {Conventional programming languages are growing ever more
enormous, but not stronger. Inherent defects at the most
basic level cause them to be both fat and weak: their
primitive word-at-a-time style of programming inherited from
their common ancestorthe von Neumann computer, their close
coupling of semantics to state transitions, their division
of programming into a world of expressions and a world of
statements, their inability to effectively use powerful
combining forms for building new programs from existing
ones, and their lack of useful mathematical properties for
reasoning about programs.An alternative functional style of
programming is founded on the use of combining forms for
creating programs. Functional programs deal with structured
data, are often nonrepetitive and nonrecursive, are
hierarchically constructed, do not name their arguments, and
do not require the complex machinery of procedure
declarations to become generally applicable. Combining forms
can use high level programs to build still higher level ones
in a style not possible in conventional languages.Associated
with the functional style of programming is an algebra of
programs whose variables range over programs and whose
operations are combining forms. This algebra can be used to
transform programs and to solve equations whose unknowns
are programs in much the same way one transforms equations
in high school algebra. These transformations are given by
algebraic laws and are carried out in the same language in
which programs are written. Combining forms are chosen not
only for their programming power but also for the power of
their associated algebraic laws. General theorems of the
algebra give the detailed behavior and termination
conditions for large classes of programs.A new class of
computing systems uses the functional programming style both
in its programming language and in its state transition
rules. Unlike von Neumann languages, these systems have
semantics loosely coupled to statesonly one state
transition occurs per major computation.},

   abstract  = {The designers of (functional) programming languages are
faced with two occasionally conflicting goals: programmer
convenience and semantic simplicity. For example, it is
convenient to treat I/O operations as primitive functions
with side effects, but doing so destroys referential
transparency.FL is a functional language that is designed to
trade some of the semantic simplicity of a pure language for
some of the convenience of a procedural language, by treating
I/O operations as primitives with side effects, but by
using a structuring technique that localizes the scope of
those effects. In this way, surprisingly little of the
semantic simplicity is lost, as can be seen by comparing the
underlying algebraic laws of FL with those of its pure
counterpart. FP.This paper describes that comparison and
shows that, in fact, for programs involving I/O, the
structures of the algebraic laws of the two languages are
identical! It concludes by showing that this technique cannot
be extended to allow assignment statements without incurring
a massive loss in the expressiveness and simplicity of the
underlying algebra.},

   abstract   = {In many areas of applied geometric/numeric computational
mathematics, including geo-mapping, computer vision,
computer graphics, finite element analysis, medical imaging,
geometric design, and solid modeling, one has to compute
incidences, adjacencies, and ordering of cells, generally
using disparate and often incompatible data structures and
algorithms. This article introduces computational topology
algorithms to discover the two-dimensional (2D)/3D space
partition induced by a collection of geometric objects of
dimension 1D/2D, respectively. Methods and language are
those of basic geometric and algebraic topology. Only sparse
vectors and matrices are used to compute both spaces and
maps, i.e., the chain complex, from dimension zero to three.
The prototype software is written in Julia, the novel
language for scientific computing. The applications may vary
from 3D graphics to 3D printing, from images to scene
understanding, and from games to building information
modeling.},

article introduces Chains, a computer language whose basic
datatypes are cells, cell complexes, and k-chains. To
illustrate how Chains may be used in numerical computing, we
develop a two page Chains program that completely specifies a
finite element solution to plane strain, including symbolic
definition of quadratic shape functions, the related element
stiffness matrices, and an algebraic-topological
specification of the assembly process. In contrast to a
textbook derivation of the finite element method (which it
closely resembles), this program is a fully formal finite
element computation, and hence is a step towards the goal of
improving the process of creating software for scientific
computing by raising the semantic level at which physical
systems are specified.},

   abstract = {We describe one of the first attempts at using modern
specification techniques in the field of geometric modeling
and computational geometry. Using the Coq system, we developed
a formal multi-level specification of combinatorial maps, used
to represent subdivisions of geometric manifolds, and then
exploited it to formally prove fundamental theorems. In
particular, we outline here an original and constructive proof
of a combinatorial part of the famous Surface Classification
Theorem, based on a set of so-called conservative elementary
operations on subdivisions.},

geometric structures that are popular for interpolation and
mesh generation because they respect the shapes of planar
domains, they have ``nicely shaped'' triangles that optimize
several criteria, and they are easy to construct and update.
The present work generalizes constrained Delaunay
triangulations (CDTs) to higher dimensions and describes
constrained variants of regular triangulations, here
christened weighted CDTs and constrained regular
triangulations. CDTs and weighted CDTs are powerful and
practical models of geometric domains, especially in two and
three dimensions.},

Julia's productivity features include: dynamic typing, automatic memory management, rich type annotations, and multiple dispatch. At the same time, Julia allows programmers to control memory layout and leverages a specializing just-in-time compiler to eliminate much of the overhead of those features. This paper details the design choices made by the creators of Julia and reflects on the implications of those choices for performance and usability.},
